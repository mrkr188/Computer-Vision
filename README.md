# CSCI-B 657 Computer Vision
One of the most challenging course here at Indiana University Bloomington by reputed professor [David Crandall](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~djcran/). In this course we were formed into teams of 3 for each of the assignments. This repository contains code and reports of my work. 
  
In the assignments I implemented many Computer Vision algoritms from scratch in C++. Some of the interesting algorithms include Edge Detection, Image template Maching, Image Retrival using SIFT descriptors, Image Mosaicing application using RANSAC, Bag of Visual Words, Convolutional Neural Networks, Image Segmentation using Hidden Markov Models, Viola Jones Face Detection.
